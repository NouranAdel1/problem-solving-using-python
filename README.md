## Inverting a Coin Triangle

**Description:**
Consider an equilateral triangle formed by closely packed pennies or other identical coins. Use iterative improvement method to design an algorithm to flip the triangle upside down in the minimum number of moves if on each move you can slide one coin at a time to its new position.

## Peg Solitaire

**Description:**
Consider the one-dimensional version of peg solitaire played on an array of n cells. Write an algorithm that removes all but one peg by a sequence of moves and finds all the locations of the empty cell in the initial setup for which the puzzle can be solved.

**Test Example:**
**The current setup yielded no feasible solution.**
