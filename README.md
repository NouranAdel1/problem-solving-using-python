## Inverting a Coin Triangle

**Description:**
Consider an equilateral triangle formed by closely packed pennies or other identical coins. Use iterative improvement method to design an algorithm to flip the triangle upside down in the minimum number of moves if on each move you can slide one coin at a time to its new position.

**Files:**
- `coin_triangle.py`: Contains the implementation of the algorithm to flip the coin triangle upside down.

## Peg Solitaire

**Description:**
Consider the one-dimensional version of peg solitaire played on an array of n cells. Write an algorithm that removes all but one peg by a sequence of moves and finds all the locations of the empty cell in the initial setup for which the puzzle can be solved.

**Files:**
- `peg_solitaire.py`: Contains the implementation of the algorithm to solve peg solitaire.

## Knights Exchange

**Description:**
There are six knights on a 3 × 4 chessboard. Design an iterative improvement algorithm to exchange the knights to get the specified position in the minimum number of moves, not allowing more than one knight on a square at any time.

**Files:**
- `knights_exchange.py`: Contains the implementation of the algorithm to exchange the knights.

## Penny Machine

**Description:**
A “machine” consists of a row of boxes. Design an algorithm using Brute Force method to automate the machine and answer questions about its behavior.

**Files:**
- `penny_machine.py`: Contains the implementation of the algorithm to automate the penny machine.

## Security Switches

**Description:**
There is a row of n security switches protecting a military installation entrance. Design a Divide and Conquer algorithm to turn off all the switches in the minimum number of moves.

**Files:**
- `security_switches.py`: Contains the implementation of the Divide and Conquer algorithm for turning off the switches.

## Tower of Hanoi

**Description:**
Use divide and conquer method to transfer all the disks from one peg to another peg.

**Files:**
- `tower_of_hanoi.py`: Contains the implementation of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle solver.
